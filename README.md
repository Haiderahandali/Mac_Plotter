# a Light weight 2D_Plotter for MacOS.
my brother needed a simple 2d plotter for his highschool math class, 
couldn't find one that was simple for high-school students and free in the same time, so I created one.




# It can plot differnet equations like sin(x) , log(x) sqrt(x).

# The Application provide a step of 0.25 and -1 to 1 range if any is not provided.

# it can plot multiple expression (cos(x^2) * log(x)).

# this is a small demo of how the app works.
