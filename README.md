# a light weight 2D_Plotter for MacOS.
my brother needed a simple 2d plotter for his highschool math class, 
couldn't find one that was simple for high-school students and free in the same time, so I created one.

# The Application provide a step of 0.25 and -1 to 1 range if any is not provided.

# It can plot differnet equations like sin(x) , log(x) sqrt(x) and so on.

# it can plot multiple expression within  a single plot (such as log(x) * cos(x^2))
